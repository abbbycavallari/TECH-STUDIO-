                            <br> I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also 
                            <br>master the soft skills required for being a software developer.<br>
                            So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing <br>
                            push in my career as a software developer.<br><br>

                    <p>There's never been a better time to start a career as a web developer because there<br>
                         is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality code and <br>
                         experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions. <br><br>
                        The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way we do business<br>
                         globally, and is disrupting industries from education to manufacturing. </p><br>
                         <h6><b>What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion 
                             Of<br> The Course?</b></h6>

                                programming languages â€“ JavaScript & Python. Youâ€™ll have built several full-stack<br>
                                 applications of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in a <br>
                                 development environment. <br><br>
                                Youâ€™ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies in an ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll <br>
                                have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web development â€“<br>

                                  and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to scale. </p><br>
                                  <h6><b>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</b></h6>
                                  <p>Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB RAM with a<br>

                                    At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but no previous<br>
                                     programming language experience is required. </p><br>
